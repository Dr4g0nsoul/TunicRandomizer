# TunicRandomizer
- Still work in progress. Basic randomization works (Chests only without trinkets).
- All Items besides Shop Items and Pages are randomized
- Bepinex IL2CPP (Bleeding Edge) needed: https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be
-- Copy Bepinex Folder in Steam game Folder and Start the Game
-- More files should appear with a unhollowed Folder inside the Bepinex Folder
-- Include them into your vscode project and use Programms like dotPeek to find hooks.
- To play... better wait until the first release xD

# Tunic Item Randomizer

## Randomized Items as for now:
- All chest Items including fairies
- Equipment and Keys that can be picked up
- The 3 hexagons

## Missing items to be added in the randomization pool
- Shop Items
- Pages

## Useful hints
- Randomization does NOT prevent softlocks as of yet. Use Keyboard Button I to spawn bombs if you are stuck at the beginning (with the cost of half of your HP :P).
- If you are stuck inside a level with no way out press Left-ALT followed by 0 and then again LEFT-ALT. This will warp you to the first entrance. If you want you can use other numbers to travel to other level exits if you so choose.
- Use Keyboard Button T to look up your current Seed.
- You can also use Keyboard Button N to switch between night and daytime.

## Future improvements and bugfixes planned
- Use of custom seeds
- Save randomization settings and progress (right now the item randomizer does not work with save files at all)
- Progression based randomization
- Different randomization options (Like which item types to randomize, locking abilities (e.g. Praying and Rolling) behind a chest, ...)

## Ideas that might be added in the distant future
- Area Randomizer
- Multiworld support
